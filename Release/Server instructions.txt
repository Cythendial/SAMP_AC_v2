To setup a server to use AC v2.0 all you need to do is place 
sampac.dll (if your server is windows) 
or 
sampac.so (if your server is linux) in the plugins folder.

open server.cfg and in the plugins line add sampac.dll (Windows) or sampac.so (Linux).

and place ac_config.ini in your server's main directory (where samp-server.exe is on windows, or sam03svr is on linux)

Restart your server. 

The files in the filterscript folder, and in the PAWNO folder are not necessary to install unless you're a scripter.

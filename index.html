<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is SA:MP AC?.</h3>

<p>SA:MP AC is a Client-side application that runs on all users computers. It establishes a connection with the server your own using <a href="https://github.com/OculusVR/RakNet">RakNet</a>. The same connection library that SA:MP itself uses!</p>
<p>Once it's connected to the server it can send back and forth immediate information from the server to the client or vice-versa.</p>
<p>Oh, also, it's encrypted.</p>



<h3>
<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How is this better than SA:MP AC v1?</h3>

<p>SA:MP AC v1 was a great application, and withstood the test of time by protecting A/D clanwars for more than 2 years. However, it was held back by many glaring problems that could not really be solved.</p>
<p>I'll briefly explain a couple of problems.</p>

<p>- One major problem was the time that it took for a user to be detected as using a cheat, or turned off the AC. It could take up to 5 minutes. There was also some odd compatability problems and some people were actually able to go for an hour or two without getting picked up</p>
<p>This was caused by the many layers of network code that had to go through. In the old AC, information would go from C++ (JNI) -> Java -> PHP -> MySQL. Sometime after the info was input in the MySQL. the server would retrieve it, MySQL -> PHP -> PAWN.</p>
<p>There was no direct communication between the AC and the server in this way.</p>
<p>This has been solved by making direct communication with the server through RakNet.</p>

<p>- Another problem with the old AC was closing the .exe, forgetting to open it, or whatever, the extra .EXE was just a hassle to deal with in general.</p>
<p>This problem has been solved by making AC version 2 an *.ASI mod.</p>

<p>There were many many other issues that would take a long time to explain, but briefly, I explained a couple.</p>

<h3>
<a name="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Does this new version include anything but fixed problems?</h3>

<p>Yes. With this new version of AC, it was a very early design goal of mine to not only detect cheats, but to prevent them from ever working at all.</p>
<p>The list of NEW things detected in this version is here:</p>

<p>- GTA3.img files - Skin files are scanned in gta3.img.</p>
<p>- Basic macros will not work.</p>
<p>- weapon.dat further integrity checks.</p>
<p>- DirectX hooks</p>
<p>- Lite foot is disabled by default (though the server can enable it).</p>

<p>This adds onto the list of already detected things, as well as prevention was really a big deal. There are not many cheats that are working, even if undetected.</p>

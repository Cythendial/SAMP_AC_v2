<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is SA:MP AC?</h3>

<p>SA:MP AC is a Client-side application that runs on all users computers. It establishes a connection with the server you're on, and sends info back and forth. </p>

<h3>
<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How is this better than SA:MP AC v1? (Why was this recoded from scratch and the old version not just improved?)</h3>

<p>SA:MP AC v1 was a great application, and withstood the test of time by protecting A/D clanwars for more than 2 years. However, it was held back by many glaring problems that could not really be solved.</p>
<p>I'll explain a couple of problems.</p>

<p>- One major problem was the time that it took for a user to be detected as using a cheat, or turned off the AC. It could take up to 5 minutes. There was also some odd compatability problems and some people were actually able to go for an hour or two without getting picked up</p>
<p>This was caused by the many layers of network code that had to go through. In the old AC, information would go from C++ (JNI) -> Java -> PHP -> MySQL. Sometime after the info was input in the MySQL. the server would retrieve it, MySQL -> PHP -> PAWN.</p>
<p>There was no direct communication between the AC and the server in this way.</p>
<p>This has been solved by making direct communication with the server through RakNet.</p>

<p>- Another problem with the old AC was closing the .exe, forgetting to open it, or whatever, the extra .EXE was just a hassle to deal with in general.</p>
<p>This problem has been solved by making AC version 2 an *.ASI mod.</p>

<p>There were many many other issues that would take a long time to explain, but briefly, I explained a couple.</p>

<p>To answer the second question, This was re-made from scratch for many reasons. One of them was that it would've taken longer to fix up the first AC then to redo it from the begining.</p>
<p>Another reason is I wanted this AC to have very little dependcy on me as I have almost no interest in continuing to "reinvent the wheel" with the AAD/GTA:T community in SA:MP. It's very easy to break things, but it times time and effort to build things. The GTA:T community lacks any semblance of a group of civilized individuals with the exception of a very small percent.</p>
<p>Don't get the facts twisted, this AC was not made for you. It was made for enjoyment, and I got plenty of enjoyment making it.</p>
